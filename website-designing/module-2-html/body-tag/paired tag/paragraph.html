            Devotees fast, sing devotional songs, and perform various rituals to honor Krishna's life and teachings.

            One of the most popular traditions is the Dahi Handi event, where groups of young men form human pyramids to break a pot filled with curd, butter, or milk hung at a height. 
            Bhajan and Kirtan sessions are organized throughout the day, creating a spiritual and festive atmosphere. 
            Families prepare special sweets and distribute Prasad among friends and neighbors.

            Community gatherings strengthen social bonds and promote the spirit of devotion and joy. 
            Janmashtami celebrations vary across regions, but the core essence of devotion, music, dance, and joy remains universal.
