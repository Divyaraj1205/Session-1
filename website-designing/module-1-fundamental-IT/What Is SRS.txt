What Is SRS ?

SRS Means Software Requirements Specification 

Definition:
- SRS is a detailed document that describes the software system to be developed, including its functional and non-functional requirements.
- It serves as a contract between the client and the developer.

Example:
- For a Library Management System, the SRS would specify requirements like:
    - The system must allow users to search for books.
    - The system must track borrowed and returned books.

Types of Requirements in SRS:
1. Functional Requirements
     - Describe what the system should do.
     - Example: The system should allow users to log in.

2. Non-Functional Requirements
     - Describe how the system performs its functions.
     - Example: The system should respond to user queries within 2 seconds.

3. Interface Requirements
     - Specify how the system interacts with other systems or users.
     - Example: The system should integrate with the university database.

4. Performance Requirements
     - Define performance criteria.
     - Example: The system should support 100 simultaneous users.

5. Security Requirements
     - Specify security measures.
     - Example: User data must be encrypted.

Summary:
- SRS is essential for clear communication and successful software development.
