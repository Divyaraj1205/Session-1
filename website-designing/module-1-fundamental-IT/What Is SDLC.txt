What Is SDLC?

Definition :

SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications. It defines the steps involved in software development from inception to retirement.

Types of SDLC Models (with definitions and examples):

1. Waterfall Model
    - Definition: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
    - Example: Building a payroll system where requirements are well understood.

2. Agile Model
    - Definition: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback.
    - Example: Developing a mobile app with frequent updates based on user feedback.

3. V-Model (Verification and Validation Model)
    - Definition: An extension of the Waterfall model where each development stage is associated with a testing phase.
    - Example: Creating medical software where validation at each stage is critical.

4. Iterative Model
    - Definition: Software is developed and improved through repeated cycles (iterations), allowing refinement at each stage.
    - Example: Designing a website where features are added and improved over several releases.

5. Spiral Model
    - Definition: Combines iterative development with risk analysis, focusing on risk assessment at every cycle.
    - Example: Large-scale enterprise systems where risk management is essential.

6. Big Bang Model
    - Definition: Development starts with little planning and resources are allocated as needed; suitable for small projects.
    - Example: Prototyping a simple tool without defined requirements.
