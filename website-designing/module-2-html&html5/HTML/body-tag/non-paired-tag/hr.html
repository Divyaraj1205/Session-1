Shri Krishna Janmashtami is one of the most joyful and divine festivals celebrated across India and around the world. It marks the birth of Lord Krishna, the eighth avatar of Lord Vishnu, who is considered the embodiment of love, compassion, and righteousness. 
On this auspicious day, devotees decorate temples and homes with flowers, lights, and rangoli. The chanting of “Hare Krishna” and melodious bhajans fill the atmosphere with devotion and peace. Fasting is observed throughout the day, and at midnight, when Lord Krishna is believed to have been born, devotees break their fast with prasad, sweets, and fruits.

One of the highlights of Janmashtami is the famous “Dahi Handi” celebration, where groups of young people form human pyramids to break a pot filled with curd, butter, and sweets, symbolizing Krishna’s playful and mischievous nature. The festival beautifully blends devotion with celebration, reminding everyone of the eternal message of dharma, love, and joy that Lord Krishna brought to humanity.
